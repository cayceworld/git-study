		<h4>By Travis Scott</h4>

			<p>[Verse 1: Travis Scott]<br>
				Custom the things, custom the wings<br>
				I had to custom the vibe, custom the link up<br>
				Cover the back of the lab, <span class="first annotation">front cover magazine <span class="first-ann-text">Travis Scott has covered dozens of albums in his career, with a significant uptick in frequency and notoriety in the years following ASTROWORLD. Some notable covers include, but are not limited to: Forbes (50 Under 50 Edition), Rolling Stone, XXL, GQ, i-D, AnOther Magazine, and Paper.</span> </span> <br>
				Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)<br>
				Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)<br>
				Our misery really ain't nothin' to see<br>
				I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)<br>
				Bring out a bag of the weed<br>
				<br>
				Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve<br>
				Rather you leave, then you go back out on me<br>
				Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least<br>
				You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week<br>
				Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet<br>
				We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: Travis Scott]<br>
				We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck<br>
				Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck<br>
				City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust<br>
				<br>
				[Verse 2: Travis Scott]<br>
				Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count<br>
				Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave<br>
				Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house<br>
				You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'<br>
				<br>
				Step by step, watch yourself<br>
				Cleaners got anything you might've left<br>
				I couldn't do none of this by myself<br>
				With mafia, they in the tuck<br>
				I gave you fifty to boost up your butt<br>
				I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed<br>
				I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club<br>
				Know what to do, you rattled me up<br>
				Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages<br>
				Got a couple of vibrations<br>
				For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: J. Cole &amp; Travis Scott]<br>
				(Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)<br>
				We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall
				through this town today)<br>
				Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas
				around)<br>
				City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that
				can't be around today)<br>
				<br>
				[Interlude: Travis Scott]<br>
				Mm, mm, woah-ah, mm-mm<br>
				Woah, mm-mm, mm-mm<br>
				(Ooh)<br>
				Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
				Drop down<br>
				Run around, run around<br>
				<br>
				[Chorus: J. Cole &amp; ravis Scott]<br>
				(Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)<br>
				We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall
				through this town today)
				Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas
				around)<br>
